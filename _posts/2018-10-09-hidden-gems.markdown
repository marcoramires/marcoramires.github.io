**In celebration** of the daylight savings.

For this specific shooting I had in mind 'soft water' compositions in combination with warm tonality. Believe or not I have got a pair of sunglasses that replicates the exact effect I am trying to achieve here.

It's really warm in tonality and it gets quite foggy if not spotless cleaned. It brings me back to when I was in California and everything has that smooth yellowish tone... Add the palm trees and you are there!

I tend to pick a fixed aperture for the effect I am trying to achieve (f/2.5) and set the camera in AV mode. Constant ISO 100 and exposure compensation to -1 in order to trick the camera and give this darker mood. It's something I used to do a lot when shooting film and I would ask the photo lab to balance the exposure bracket to whatever I wanted later.

I hope you like the result.

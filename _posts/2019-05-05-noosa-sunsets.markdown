**Yes** I moved to the Sunshine Coast.

It's always been on my bucket list to move to the Sunny Coast and spend more time in warm waters as well as enjoy the laid-back Australian way of living.

My day job is in Mooloolaba, nice little beach-town with great cafes right next to Alexandra Headland. Plenty of waves up this way and the crowd is 'less intense' than any other place I visited in Australia. Well... apart from Tasmania where there was no one but seals in the freezing water with me.

I am spending a lot of time in Noosa Heads which I always found to be really inspiring for surfing/water photography. Because of its position, mornings are glorious when the sun usually takes a little longer to pop-up behind the hills and spectacular sunsets where depending on your position the sun will set right in the water.

This shooting in specific I was jumping off 'Boiling Pot' and drifting with the current towards the 'Car Park'. My number one camera (Canon EOS 70D) is pretty much dead. It only woks on the 'Manual' mode and my usual settings while in the water are very specific using the 'Av (aperture priority)' mode. That's probably the only reason I would buy a new camera body. 

I personally think any equipment should be the secondary element on the photographer's creative process. Limitations are probably the key for innovation and finding your own style. But if the camera doesn't work it means I need a new one.

I am in between two cameras at moment that would be a good match to my lenses, Canon EOS R and Sony A7III.

Please feel free to reach out anytime if you ever used these cameras before for this kind of purpose.

Camera settings: Aquatech Housing + Canon EOS 70D + 50mm f/1.4 :: Manual Mode ISO Auto f/2.8 1/1000

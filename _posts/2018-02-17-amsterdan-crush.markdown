**Sometimes you just wish** you could stay a little longer in bed! 

I knew it would be a good morning with the fresh NE swell and very light wind. So yeah... it's a 5:00am start.

Perfect day: Wake up slow (early), listen to the birds, watch the sunrise, drink favorite coffee, eat well, spend quality time with someone you like, a couple of waves, rest up!

The portrait shots are real... lol. I didn't know I could look that cool. That's what happens when you hangout with talented people. 

I hope you all had a great weekend.

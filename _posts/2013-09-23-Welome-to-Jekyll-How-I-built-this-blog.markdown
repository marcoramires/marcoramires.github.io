I have tried to get into writing articles before but I always found extremely hard work specially because all I wanted was a simple tool to publish code snippets in an easy way.

Most of the time I had an amazing blog tool with database, themes, dashboard and all the things I needed to start writing which never happened.

Recently, a friend introduced me **[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)** and the concept of having a static blog that sits at **[GitHub](http://github.com/)** using **[GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/)**.

Installing **[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)** locally is very straight forward and the **[documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/)** provides enough information to get you started.

I also took the chance to add minor front-end dev which combines **[Twitter Bootstrap 3.0](http://getbootstrap.com/)**, **[Bootswatch Readable](http://bootswatch.com/readable/)** and a lot of inspiration from **[Medium](https://medium.com/)**.

I will be implementing more features soon, so feel free to clone and use it.

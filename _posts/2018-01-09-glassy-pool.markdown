**What a beautiful morning!** I was so bummed out for missing the sunrise yesterday.

It was an early 5:00am start today. Happy Friday!

The wind has finally pulled back a bit and conditions improved a lot. Bondi Icebergs pool was looking absolutely stunning, super clean and glassy.

There are still plenty of swell around and some really good runners in the south end. Banks are looking a little funny after the big swell... Let's wait for a couple of days to see what happens.

I will be out for a surf this arvo. So hit me up if you are keen to share a couple of waves.

Enjoy your day and have a lovely weekend.

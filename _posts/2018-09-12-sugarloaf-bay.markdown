**Split shots** It's a lot harder than you think.

As you may I know, I am getting into water photography more and more. Each time in the water is different and extremely challenging in many ways.

It reminds me a lot of surfing where you need to combine the knowledge of the location with the equipment you have to use.

I recently bought a large **Aquatech Dome Port P-85** to match up with my favorite fisheye lens **Tokina 10-17mm**. After a bit of reading I decided to give it a go and try some split shots without huge expectations.

**Things I had in mind:** decent shutter speed (min 1/60), AI Servo Focus, clear water and usual 'golden hour'.

**Things I didn't think of:** smaller aperture for wide angle details, auto ISO compensation, different exposures in between water and sky.

**Next time:** midday sun for more detail in the water, set the camera mode to AV, set the aperture to constant f/11 which I find to be the 'sweet spot' for the Tokina 10-17mm, min shutter speed to 1/60 and auto ISO compensation.

It's all about having fun!

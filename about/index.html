    <p><strong>Brazilian / Portuguese / Australian / Surfer / Inventor / Technologist / Programmer</strong></p>
    <p>My best friend once lent me a Pentax 35mm from his University and taught me how to capture light into film. The camera mechanism absolutely fascinated me and I was hooked.</p>
    <p>I thought... <i>"If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour... you're gonna see some serious shit."</i></p>
    <p>All the images you see on the site are for sale. For more information, or if you'd like to ask any questions about photography in general, please don't hesitate to contact me.</p>
